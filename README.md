# Data Structures & Algorithms Learning Repository

A personal repository for exploring **Data Structures and Algorithms** essential to modern computer science. This project serves as a accessible resource for college coursework and personal experimentation with fundamental algorithms.

## Purpose:

This repository is designed to:

- **Store and organize** DSA implementations accessible from anywhere,
- **Explore** various algorithms and data structures taught in CSIT coursework,
- **Document** both college lab assignments and personal experimentation projects,
- **Practice** implementing core computer science concepts,
- **Reference** common patterns and solutions for future use.

## Contents

The repository includes implementations of:

- **Data Structures**: Arrays, Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Hash Tables, Heaps, etc.
- **Algorithms**: Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming, Graph Traversal, etc.
- **Lab Assignments**: Solutions and implementations from CSIT coursework
- **Experiments**: Personal projects exploring algorithm behavior and optimization

## Technologies

- **Language**: C/C++
- **Compiler**: GCC/G++ (MinGW)
- **Platform**: Windows/Cross-platform compatible

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- GCC/G++ compiler installed (MinGW for Windows)
- Basic C/C++ knowledge

### Building & Running

1. Navigate to the repository directory
2. Compile a file using:
   ```bash
   gcc -g filename.c -o filename.exe
   # or
   g++ -g filename.cpp -o filename.exe
   ```
3. Run the compiled executable:
   ```bash
   ./filename.exe
   ```

## Learning Goals
